# Semiconductor-Packaging-Workshop
A 10 day workshop on Introduction of semiconductor packaging
## Module 3 : Thermal Simulation of Semiconductor Package with ANSYS
This Lab is to know the package structure and analysis of thermal package .
The tool used is ANYSYS electronics desktop student of ANSYS website. 
Once opened the window would have multiple tools inserted/packaged in this software.

The list is as follows:
1. HFSS - for electromagnetic design
2. Q3D - Extractor
3. Circuit element - circuit
4. Icepack
5. Maxwell
6. Simplore
The tool used for thermal analysis is Icepack.
Tools - Icepack, will create 
Importing the geometry of Flipchip-BGA package and setting up analysis and discussing all
